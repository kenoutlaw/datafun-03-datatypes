# Number of Work Days in a Month: 20
# Total Number of Employee Hours: 180
# Average Number of Employee Hours per Count: 9.0
# Employee Hours Count Set: {7, 8, 9, 10, 11}
# Employee Hours Sorted (Ascending): [7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 11, 11, 11]

# List 4. List Methods
# lst: [36, 58, 117, 5, 89, 37, 108, 122]
# Appended lst: [36, 58, 117, 5, 89, 37, 108, 122, 2]
# Extended lst: [36, 58, 117, 5, 89, 37, 108, 122, 2, 41, 66, 27, 82, 94]
# Insert the value of 14: [36, 58, 117, 14, 5, 89, 37, 108, 122, 2, 41, 66, 27, 82, 94]
# List items and Remove the value 5: [36, 58, 117, 14, 89, 37, 108, 122, 2, 41, 66, 27, 82, 94]
# The value 2 appears 1 times in lst.
# First Sorted in Ascending Order: [2, 14, 27, 36, 37, 41, 58, 66, 82, 89, 94, 108, 117, 122]
# First Sorted in Descending Order: [122, 117, 108, 94, 89, 82, 66, 58, 41, 37, 36, 27, 14, 2]
# Copy of lst: [122, 117, 108, 94, 89, 82, 66, 58, 41, 37, 36, 27, 14, 2]
# First item off of the list: 122
# Last item off of the list: 2

# List 5. List Transformations - Using filter() and map()
# The cuberoot of each item in the list are: [729, 1000, 512, 512, 729, 343, 1331, 1000, 729, 512, 1000, 1331, 343, 512, 1000, 729, 1331, 512, 343, 1000]
# The volume of a cube with a side equal to the value in list1 are [729, 1000, 512, 512, 729, 343, 1331, 1000, 729, 512, 1000, 1331, 343, 512, 1000, 729, 1331, 512, 343, 1000]

# Lists 6. List Transformations - Using List Comprehension
# The Result of Filtering lst if value is less than 4 is []
# Each value in lst tripled is [351, 324, 282, 267, 246, 198, 174, 123, 111, 108, 81, 42]
# The Result of Adding 150 to Each value in lst is [267, 258, 244, 239, 232, 216, 208, 191, 187, 186, 177, 164]
